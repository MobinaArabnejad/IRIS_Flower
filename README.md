# IRIS Flower Classification (Logistic Regression)

This repository contains a simple end-to-end machine learning classification project using the classic Iris dataset.
It was my first complete ML project built with scikit-learn, focusing on a clean workflow: data loading, training, evaluation, and visualization.

# What this project does
- Loads the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets
- Builds feature matrix X and target vector y
- Splits data into train/test sets
- Trains a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluates performance using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report (optional)
- Visualizes the confusion matrix as a heatmap

# Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
